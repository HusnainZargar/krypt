# Krypt — Password Breach Checker &amp; GPU Crack-Time Estimator

Krypt is a privacy-focused cybersecurity tool that lets users:

✔ Check if their password is leaked using the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) API.

✔ Estimate GPU-based brute-force cracking time (RTX 4090, 3090, CPUs, etc.)

✔ Keep everything 100% client-side, ensuring no password ever touches your server

Krypt uses secure SHA-1 k-anonymity, no logging, and local GPU-speed calculations — making it one of the safest free password-intelligence tools available.
